# RPB XML Toolkit

**A fast, native macOS workspace for repairing and preparing Final Cut Pro XML.**

RPB XML Toolkit helps post-production teams inspect, clean up, relink, and export
large batches of Final Cut Pro `xmeml` v4/v5 XML files. It keeps the original XML
structure in memory while giving you a practical visual workspace for media,
timelines, source timecode, and reference video.

> **Alpha software:** The current public build is intended for evaluation on
> copies of your project XML. Keep backups of original media and timelines.

## Download

Get the latest **Developer ID–signed and Apple-notarized** alpha build from the
[v1.0.0 Alpha 1 release](https://github.com/dr1pvfx/xml-fixer/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.1).

**Requirements:** macOS 14 Sonoma or later.

## What it does

- Import individual XML files, folders, or drop files directly onto the app.
- Inspect media across all loaded XMLs in one deduplicated list.
- Browse timelines visually, scrub a frame-accurate playhead, and inspect clips
  and effects.
- Link reference videos and synchronize them with the active timeline using
  source timecode.
- Relink media paths to a new conform location and copy linked media into a
  collected delivery folder.
- Match reference videos to timelines, including review and manual overrides
  before applying matches.
- Edit filenames, paths, reel metadata, and timeline start timecode.
- Remove selected media, strip audio tracks, flatten nested sequences, and
  batch-rename timelines.
- Export updated XMLs, a concise media CSV, or a Sources Sequence XML containing
  the best-length source ranges for a conform workflow.
- Trim camera originals down to the used ranges (plus handles) without
  re-encoding, similar to DaVinci Resolve's Media Management trim mode.
- Calculate common scale and resize values without leaving the app.

## Typical workflow

1. **Import** the XML files or the containing folder.
2. **Review** the consolidated media list and timeline view.
3. **Repair** paths, names, timecode, reel metadata, or sequence structure.
4. **Relink or collect** media when preparing a handoff.
5. **Trim** camera originals to only the frames the edit uses.
6. **Export** revised XMLs, a Sources Sequence XML, and/or a CSV report.

All XML mutations are applied to an in-memory document and can be undone during
the session. The original files are not overwritten unless you explicitly choose
their location as the export destination.

## Built for post workflows

| Area | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Media management | Consolidated media inspection, bulk edits, filename changes, relinking, and collection |
| Timeline cleanup | Batch timeline renaming, nested-sequence flattening, audio stripping, and clip removal |
| Timecode & review | Source-timecode display, timeline start-timecode editing, and synchronized reference playback |
| Delivery | Updated XML batch export, CSV media report, and Sources Sequence XML export |
| Camera originals | Lossless trimming of QuickTime (ProRes, DNx, H.264, HEVC) and image sequences (EXR, DPX, DNG, ARRIRAW .ari); R3D via REDline when installed; everything else copied whole |

## Trimming camera originals

The **Trim** toolbar action scans a folder of camera-original media, matches each
source used in the loaded XMLs by filename stem (proxies such as `A001C002.mov`
match `A001C002.R3D`, `A001C002.mxf`, or `A001C002.0001001.exr`), and writes
trimmed copies containing only the used ranges plus handles.

- Ranges are mapped through **source timecode**: the XML file's start timecode
  plus the clip in/out points is located in the original's embedded timecode
  track, so proxies that start at a different point or run at a different frame
  rate still map correctly. Files without timecode fall back to frame offsets
  and are flagged.
- Nothing is re-encoded. QuickTime files are rewritten with AVFoundation
  passthrough, so codec, bit depth, and metadata stay untouched. Cuts on
  long-GOP codecs (H.264, HEVC) snap outward to the nearest keyframes and the
  extra frames are reported.
- A new timecode track is written so the trimmed file starts at the correct
  source timecode. MP4 containers cannot carry one, which is reported.
- Image sequences are trimmed by copying only the frames in range.
- RED `.R3D` clips (including multi-segment `_001`, `_002` clips inside `.RDC`
  folders) are trimmed with REDline when REDCINE-X Pro is installed (a
  **Locate...** button lets you point at the executable). Output follows RED's
  `<clip>.RDC/<clip>_001.R3D` layout with audio, absolute and edge timecode, and
  reel ID preserved. Without REDline, and for ARRIRAW MXF, BRAW, and other formats
  with no lossless trimmer, the whole clip is copied and flagged.
- Output keeps the original filename and mirrors the folder structure under the
  destination. When a source has several used ranges farther apart than the
  merge gap, they become `name_trim01.ext`, `name_trim02.ext`, and so on.

R3D trimming shells out to an external tool, so the direct-download build runs
without the macOS App Sandbox. The App Store build keeps the sandbox and copies
R3D clips whole.

## Build from source

The app has no external runtime dependencies. Open
`XMLFixer/XMLFixer.xcodeproj` in Xcode, select the `XMLFixer` scheme, and run it.

Or build and test from Terminal:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/dr1pvfx/xml-fixer.git
cd xml-fixer

# Run the test suite without requiring local signing credentials
xcodebuild -project XMLFixer/XMLFixer.xcodeproj -scheme XMLFixer \
  -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath /tmp/xml-fixer-derived test \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO

# Create a local release build
xcodebuild -project XMLFixer/XMLFixer.xcodeproj -scheme XMLFixer \
  -configuration Release -derivedDataPath /tmp/xml-fixer-derived build \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

To exercise the trimmer on your own media, drop QuickTime files into
`$TMPDIR/qt-trim-manual/` and run the `QuickTimeTrimManualMediaTests` test; it
trims each file and verifies codec, audio tracks, keyframe alignment, and timecode.

The local release app is written to:

```text
/tmp/xml-fixer-derived/Build/Products/Release/RPB XML Toolkit.app
```

## Development notes

`FCPXMLDocument.xmlDocument` is the source of truth for an imported document.
Changes operate directly on that XML document and are serialized only at export.
The detailed architecture and project conventions live in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Feedback

This is an alpha release. If you encounter an XML structure, media format, or
workflow that needs better support, please [open an issue](https://github.com/dr1pvfx/xml-fixer/issues) with a reproducible description. Do not attach sensitive production media or client XML unless you are authorized to share it.
