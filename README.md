# RPB XML Toolkit

**A fast, native macOS workspace for repairing and preparing Final Cut Pro XML.**

RPB XML Toolkit helps post-production teams inspect, clean up, relink, and export
large batches of Final Cut Pro `xmeml` v4/v5 XML files. It keeps the original XML
structure in memory while giving you a practical visual workspace for media,
timelines, source timecode, and reference video.

> **Alpha software:** The current public build is intended for evaluation on
> copies of your project XML. Keep backups of original media and timelines.

## Download

Get the latest **Developer ID–signed and Apple-notarized** alpha build from the
[v1.0.0 Alpha 1 release](https://github.com/dr1pvfx/xml-fixer/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.1).

**Requirements:** macOS 14 Sonoma or later.

## What it does

- Import individual XML files, folders, or drop files directly onto the app.
- Inspect media across all loaded XMLs in one deduplicated list.
- Browse timelines visually, scrub a frame-accurate playhead, and inspect clips
  and effects.
- Link reference videos and synchronize them with the active timeline using
  source timecode.
- Relink media paths to a new conform location and copy linked media into a
  collected delivery folder.
- Match reference videos to timelines, including review and manual overrides
  before applying matches.
- Edit filenames, paths, reel metadata, and timeline start timecode.
- Remove selected media, strip audio tracks, flatten nested sequences, and
  batch-rename timelines.
- Export updated XMLs, a concise media CSV, or a Sources Sequence XML containing
  the best-length source ranges for a conform workflow.
- Calculate common scale and resize values without leaving the app.

## Typical workflow

1. **Import** the XML files or the containing folder.
2. **Review** the consolidated media list and timeline view.
3. **Repair** paths, names, timecode, reel metadata, or sequence structure.
4. **Relink or collect** media when preparing a handoff.
5. **Export** revised XMLs, a Sources Sequence XML, and/or a CSV report.

All XML mutations are applied to an in-memory document and can be undone during
the session. The original files are not overwritten unless you explicitly choose
their location as the export destination.

## Built for post workflows

| Area | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Media management | Consolidated media inspection, bulk edits, filename changes, relinking, and collection |
| Timeline cleanup | Batch timeline renaming, nested-sequence flattening, audio stripping, and clip removal |
| Timecode & review | Source-timecode display, timeline start-timecode editing, and synchronized reference playback |
| Delivery | Updated XML batch export, CSV media report, and Sources Sequence XML export |

## Build from source

The app has no external runtime dependencies. Open
`XMLFixer/XMLFixer.xcodeproj` in Xcode, select the `XMLFixer` scheme, and run it.

Or build and test from Terminal:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/dr1pvfx/xml-fixer.git
cd xml-fixer

# Run the test suite without requiring local signing credentials
xcodebuild -project XMLFixer/XMLFixer.xcodeproj -scheme XMLFixer \
  -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath /tmp/xml-fixer-derived test \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO

# Create a local release build
xcodebuild -project XMLFixer/XMLFixer.xcodeproj -scheme XMLFixer \
  -configuration Release -derivedDataPath /tmp/xml-fixer-derived build \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

The local release app is written to:

```text
/tmp/xml-fixer-derived/Build/Products/Release/RPB XML Toolkit.app
```

## Development notes

`FCPXMLDocument.xmlDocument` is the source of truth for an imported document.
Changes operate directly on that XML document and are serialized only at export.
The detailed architecture and project conventions live in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Feedback

This is an alpha release. If you encounter an XML structure, media format, or
workflow that needs better support, please [open an issue](https://github.com/dr1pvfx/xml-fixer/issues) with a reproducible description. Do not attach sensitive production media or client XML unless you are authorized to share it.
